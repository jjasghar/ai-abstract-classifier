1,The Human Factor in DevOps: Because Even Robots Need Good Teammates (Almost),Remember when "DevOps" meant throwing code (and maybe a few passive-aggressive emails that thankfully weren’t meetings) over the wall? We’d like to think that the last decade and a half has dispelled us of that notion but has it really? Often when organizations begin their “DevOps Transformation” they focus so much on automation but the component that is more often than not overlooked is the human element. Human connection.  In this talk Jeremy will dig into some strategies for building teams that actually work together and might even come to like each other (though he can’t promise “meetings that are emails” will become a norm). He’ll talk about ways to encourage open communication resolve conflicts and create a team culture where everyone feels valued - because even the best automation tools can’t replace a team that actually works together.,Siloed teams are a major roadblock to successful DevOps adoption and so in this talk Jeremy will dial into some strategies for building collaborative high-performing teams - that might even end up liking each other. Attendees will walk away with some specific steps they can implement immediately to start improving their team dynamics.

3,Transforming Tech Leadership: 3 Ways to Shift Communication and Get Your Time Back,During this session we are going to focus on how Tech Leaders can save approx. 17 hours per week by transforming their communication algorithms. We will dive into the Process Communication Model (PCM) structures that give us ready-to-use structures tailored for both typical and high-stress environments. The session will be based on case study so you'll get a real-life Tech example that will show you how to implement this to your work and life. Let's make a real impact on strategic communication to reduce conflicts and misunderstandings so we get our time back. To focus on delivering work that really matter instead of wasting in on people drama.,none
