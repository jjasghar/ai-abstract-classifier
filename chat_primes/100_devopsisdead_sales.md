# Did you hear that DevOps is Dead?

## Abstract
Every platform engineer has experienced that moment of dread when their observability dashboard suddenly lights up with more alerts than they know what to do with. How can you keep up with all of the pings, the panic, and the pages as your CEO decided there was no use for SREs or other ops people and yet still build the next-generation platform for your company? Unlock the best that DevOps has to offer with DevOpsIsDead, the platform that brings actual operations back to the masses. DevOpsIsDead is a experience-driven SaaS product that emulates a true ops team, letting you get back to ignoring problems. We'll hear from real-life customers who have taken their time back, and we'll enjoy a live, hands-on demonstration where you get to ignore bug reports in real time! Join Minnie Sota in tossing away your pager (trash cans provided) and unleashing the power of DevOps in your organization.
