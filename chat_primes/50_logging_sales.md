# The future of logging for your systems

## Abstract
Logging isn’t just about gathering data; it’s about enhancing our natural abilities to understand the chaos around us. Logging is about following the flow of data across many surfaces, through many datacenters, and out of many devices and then generating a map of common errors and patterns so you can find your way quickly as the current gets stronger. In short, logging is about what people need to navigate our modern lives.  Let’s explore the future of logging, see what the flow of data looks like now versus in the past and how that might change into the future, and discuss how data and security are intertwined.
