# Engineering Leadership Arriving Upon A Struggling Project

## Abstract
This talk tells a first-hand tale of coming as an engineering leader to an in-flight, org-visible, almost-there-but-not-quite product launch. The story covers relevant events involved from day one through to a boring, uneventful, planned release of said product. You'll hear about tactics used as an engineering leader to help organize successful resetting of the path towards general availability of a customer-facing product in a technical organization.
